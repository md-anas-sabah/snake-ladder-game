##Snake and Ladders Game Program Design

##Game Initialization

Players: The game starts with multiple players. Store their names, e.g., "Player 1," "Player 2," etc. You can allow the players to input their names or use default names.

Current Player: Begin with the first player as the current player.

Game Board: Create the game board, which includes the positions for snakes and ladders. You can represent it as a map or an array. Initialize the players' positions at the starting point, e.g., position 1.

Game Status: Initialize the game status as "In progress."

##Game Loop

Player's Turn: The current player rolls a die (usually a six-sided die) to get a random number from 1 to 6. This number represents the number of positions they will move.

Move Player: Move the current player's position on the board based on the roll of the die. Check for snake and ladder positions and adjust accordingly.

Check for Win: After each move, check if the current player has reached position 100 (or the winning position). If so, update the game status to "Player X wins" or "Player O wins" with the player's name.

Switch Players: Switch the current player to the next player.

Check for Draw: Optionally, you can implement a rule that if the game continues for too long without a winner, it ends in a draw.

##Emerging Requirements

Store Player Names: Allow players to input their names and store them for a personalized game experience.

Current Player and Next Player: Maintain a variable to keep track of the current player and easily determine the next player in each turn.

Store the Board: Use data structures to store the game board's layout, including the positions of snakes and ladders and the current player positions.

Game Status: Track the game status, which can be "In progress," "Player X wins," "Player O wins," or "Draw."

Game Orchestration: Use functions and methods to orchestrate the game's flow, including rolling the die, moving players, checking for win conditions, and switching players.
